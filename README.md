# cosmjs-snippets

**Hello and welcome to cosmjs-snippets!**

This repository is a place where I share bits of code about *CosmJS*, especially those tackling less-known or newer features. Think of it as a collection of field notes for those navigating the world of *CosmJS*.

- **What's Inside**: Code snippets for various *CosmJS* functionalities.
- **The Goal**: To provide practical examples and maybe shed some light on the less explored corners of *CosmJS*.
- **Contributions**: Your ideas and improvements are always welcome!

**Real-World Applications:**

- **Starsdraw**: A blockchain-based lottery on *Stargaze* that offers weekly rewards. Check it out at [https://starsdraw.net](https://starsdraw.net).
- **Foxinodes**: A *Cosmos* blockchain validation activity where I've used *CosmJS* to automate certain tasks. Learn more at [https://foxinodes.net](https://foxinodes.net).

Both of these projects have given me a practical playground to apply and refine the snippets you'll find here.

Happy coding!
